@TODO: 2)   tokenize code in {const | keyword | spacing}
            this part is quite hot, we need to use special keywords
            for '(' for example, plus we need to sort the keywords by
            longer before, e.g. || before |. Special keywords must be
            handled before normal ones.
       2')  write a code compressor (removing all extra spacing/indentation)
       2'') put other languages in tests (C, Java, C++, PHP?), one after the
            other
       3)   extract inter line indentation rules
       3')  externalize language dependent keywords to the CLI
       3'') apply indentation rules
       4)   extract intra line indentation rules
